# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to create a website that takes in employee data such as first name, last name, and salary in the form of user input and order the employees alphabetically by last name. I then wanted to run a lottery system that chooses a random employee from the given list.
- In doing this I learned JavaScript functions, JSON objects, console logging, randomizing numbers, and accepting user input.
